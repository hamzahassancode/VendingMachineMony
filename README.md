# Vending Machine Money Tracker

## Overview

The Vending Machine Money Tracker class is designed to manage monetary transactions in a vending machine system. This class tracks money in terms of bills and coins, ensuring that the system can handle transactions and provide correct change to customers based on available denominations.

## Features

- **Denominations Management**: Handles various denominations of money (bills and coins).
- **Change Calculation**: Determines if the correct change can be provided based on available denominations.
- **Transaction Handling**: Supports operations like adding money, subtracting amounts for purchases, and returning change.

## Usage

### Creating Money Instances

You can create monetary amounts using predefined constants or by specifying the amount directly. For example, you can define constants for common denominations such as Dinars and Piasters.

### Performing Operations

- **Adding Money**: Add a certain amount of money to the vending machine's total.
- **Subtracting Amount**: Deduct the price of an item from the total amount provided by the customer.
- **Returning Change**: Calculate and return the appropriate change based on the available denominations.

### Error Handling

- **Insufficient Funds**: If the total amount provided by the customer is less than the item price, an exception is thrown.
- **Exact Change Required**: If it is not possible to provide the exact change with the available denominations, an exception is thrown.

## Unit Testing

The Vending Machine Money Tracker is tested to ensure accuracy and reliability. The unit tests include:

- **Addition and Subtraction**: Verify that money can be added and subtracted correctly.
- **Change Calculation**: Ensure that the system can calculate and return correct change based on available denominations.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where exact change cannot be provided or where funds are insufficient.

### Test Coverage
